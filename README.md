# Scissors-Paper-Rock

## Introduction 

This project is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The user plays against the computer, and the game is designed to run for 5 rounds, keeping track of scores and declaring a winner at the end.

## Features

- **Random Computer Choices**: The computer selects "rock", "paper", or "scissors" at random.
- **User Input**: The user can input their choice through a prompt.
- **Case Insensitivity**: The game accepts user inputs in any case (e.g., "rock", "ROCK", "RoCk").
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the score for both the human player and the computer.
- **Round Feedback**: After each round, the game announces the winner and the logic behind it (e.g., "You lose! Paper beats Rock").
- **Final Winner**: After 5 rounds, the game declares the overall winner.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Using Java to create a basic logic browser based game. 
- Added basic CSS to give some visual aesthetics 
- Using git to manage and share project 


## Possible Future Ideas to add

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Allow users to specify the number of rounds.
- Implement advanced rules or variations
